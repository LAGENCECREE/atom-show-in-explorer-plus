# show-in-explorer-plus

Alternative of "Show in explorer" fixing the problem of opening explorer in the background.

While "Show in explorer" need to be fixed on the core package.
i created this package which add an alternative entry called "üìÇ Show with explorer+".
on the right-click menu found in the Explorer Pane.

This package open windows explorer :
- on top of atom
- transfering the focus to the opened windows

Worked only for Windows OS at this point.
Tested in Windows 11.

Feel free to emprove or add methods to support others OS if needed.
